# Requirements Doc Manifest

This zip contains the following files (relative paths):

- `Requirements.md` — Overall scope, principles, priorities
- `docs/requirements/functional.md` — Functional requirements (epics + acceptance)
- `docs/requirements/nonFunctional.md` — Non-functional requirements
- `docs/requirements/dataModelAndApi.md` — Data model outline + API contract (MVP)
- `docs/requirements/pipelines.md` — Ingestion + RAG pipeline specs
- `docs/requirements/testingAndRelease.md` — Test scope + milestones
- `docs/requirements/llmProviderContract.md` — Provider abstraction contract

Notes:
- All docs are written to be AI-friendly (stable section ids, explicit P0/P1/P2, acceptance criteria).
- If you want, next step is `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN.md` (sequence diagrams + module boundaries).
